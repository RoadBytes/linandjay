Now that I'm a parent, it's hard to give a shit about anything but my kids.  I feel sorry for people around young parents becuase they are likely to get mobbed by baby pictures and stories about poopy diapers, restless nights, and first steps.  Knowing this, I still got some stickers made of my son's head and brand all my things with it.

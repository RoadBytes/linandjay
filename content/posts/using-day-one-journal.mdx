Day One App is great for iOS and macOs for capturing journals any where.

Using one app on your mac

<img
  alt="macos dayone image"
  width="160"
  src={macos}
/>

and your iPhone

<img
  alt="ios dayone image"
  src={ios}
/>

is syncs all your entries across your devices so you're never too far from capturing your life.

With a premium membership, you can add many different types of data to an entry:

* Dates
* Location information
* Images
* Videos
* Sound clips

It even syncs with other apps to record things like step count, health data, and other third party info.

## But why?

It's great to look back and take account of where I've been and what I thought about then.  I have couple young kids and even though they're only 1 and 2 years old, they've changed so much through their short lives.
